# Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 for Egyptian Arabic ASR with MGB-3 Dataset

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Egyptian Arabic, using the Multi-Genre Broadcast 3 (MGB-3) dataset.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
   - **Prepare Data**: Organize and format the MGB-3 dataset for processing.
   - **Create Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer**: Set up the tokenizer specifically for the Egyptian Arabic dialect.
   - **Create Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor**: Initialize the feature extractor for audio data.
   - **Preprocess Data**: Process the audio files and corresponding transcriptions for training.

### 2. Model Training
   - **Set-up Trainer**: Configure the training environment and parameters.
   - **Execute Training**: Train the model on the prepared dataset.

### 3. Model Evaluation
   - Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model on test data.

## Additional Resources
- **Tutorial on Fine-tuning**: For detailed steps and guidelines, follow the tutorial "[Fine-tuning XLS-R for Multi-Lingual ASR with ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-xlsr-wav2vec2)".
